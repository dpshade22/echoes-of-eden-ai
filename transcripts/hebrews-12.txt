Welcome back to the Echoes of Eden podcast! Today we delve into the narrative found in Hebrews 12 of the New Testament. The author of this chapter under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit penned these profound words:

"Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."

As we unpack this verse let's begin with the admonition to look unto Jesus. This is not a casual glance, but rather a focused determined gaze, fixing our eyes on Jesus. Jesus is our inspiration, our example, and our focal point in life. By setting our sights on Him, we can run the race set before us with endurance.

In the original Greek, this phrase carries the connotation of turning our gaze completely away from everything else and fixing it solely on Jesus. Renowned preacher Charles Spurgeon once noted "Do not even look upon the race-course or the competitors but look to Jesus and so start in the race."

Jesus is not only the author of our faith, He is also the finisher of it. This beautiful truth echoes the assurance found in Philippians 1:6, which says "He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ." Indeed Jesus remains with us, from the starting line, to the finish line, guiding and encouraging us along the way.

Now let's consider the reason Jesus endured the cross: for the joy that was set before Him. While the cross was not a joy in itself, Jesus looked beyond the suffering to the ultimate joy of a redeemed people, worshipping God, for all of eternity. In doing so, He provides an example for us to endure our own trials, knowing that good will ultimately come from them.

Through the ordeal of the cross, Jesus demonstrated resilience and tenacity. Despite facing extreme shame, He remained steadfast, keeping His tongue, His course, His progress, His joy, and His love. We too can find the strength to endure shame and hardship as we follow Jesus' example.

Spurgeon also stated: "What a shameful thing it is, that while you are bold about everything else, you are cowardly about Jesus Christ. Brave for the world and cowardly towards Christ!"

Finally the verse concludes with the affirmation that Jesus has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. This speaks to Jesus' glorification and the promise of glory that awaits us as well. May we fix our eyes on Jesus enduring our own trials, and remaining steadfast in our faith until that glorious day.
